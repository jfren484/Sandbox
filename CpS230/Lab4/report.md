# Lab 4

This assignment took me ~2.5  hours, a lot due to the fact that I was learning how to navigate a new editor (i.e. emacs).

This assignment showed me how to use emacs/spacemacs, windbg, and how to approach editing assembly, compiling, and debugging it.

Came into problems learning the editor, will continue to run into those problems for a while I'll assume. The windbg and assembly itself weren't really the issue, although the assembly code itself did look a little daunting.

I learned a lot more about a different type of editor, emacs/spacemacs, and I (probably) understand how I'll go about doing assembly projects in the future.
