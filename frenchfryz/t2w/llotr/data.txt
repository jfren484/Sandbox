1. INTRODUCTION
******************************************************************************

Welcome, welcome all my fine friends!  I don't know half of you as well as 
I should like, and I like less than half of you half as much as you deserve!
Welcome to my LEGO The Lord of the Rings walkthrough!  In this guide, you'll 
find everything you could imagine to know about this game, including 
walkthroughs of the story, how to find all the hidden collectibles, and info 
on the story and the characters.

This guide should serve you for the versions of the game for the 
Playstation 3, the XBOX 360, the Wii, and the PC.

******************************************************************************
2. FAQ
******************************************************************************

Q: What is LEGO The Lord of the Rings?

A: This is a LEGO-styled action game released in 2012 based around JRR 
 Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings series, and the Peter Jackson movies that 
 were made of the books as well.

Q: What is the ESRB rating of this game?

A: This game is rated E10+, with the added descriptors of Cartoon Violence 
 and Comic Mischief.

Q: Would this game be good for my kids?

A: If they enjoy Lord of the Rings, I'm sure they'd like this.  All violence 
 is done to LEGO bricks, so there's no blood.  Anything that was a little 
 too scary about the movies has been toned down.  As far as positive aspects 
 of the game towards kids, the gameplay is focused on exploration, discovery, 
 and critical thinking.  The co-operative gameplay style and forgiving 
 difficulty are also a plus.

Q: Is this game voiced?

A: Yes, the game features lines from the LOTR films, delivered as they 
 were in the movies by their original actors.  It also features some original 
 voice acting by non-LOTR actors on a smaller scale.

Q: How many people can play?  Is there online play?

A: Two, and no.

Q: What's new about this game compared to the recent LEGO games?

A: Like the recent LEGO Batman 2, there is a large open world to explore in 
 the form of Middle-earth.  You'll travel between the missions using this 
 open world hub, and it has many things to find in it as well.  As for 
 gameplay, characters will now have an inventory that they can use to 
 switch any items they're currently carrying.  For instance, Legolas can 
 switch between his bow and daggers.

Q: Can I save in the middle of a Story Mission?

A: You can.  At certain special points in missions, you'll see what are 
 called Save Statues.  They allow you to stop the mission and quit, then 
 start the game up again in the same spot.

Q: I'm lost!  How do I find where I'm supposed to go?

A: The next story mission is always marked by a faint blue stud trail on 
 the ground.  Follow it to where you need to go.  This can also be used in 
 conjunction with the map to track any other object that's marked.  Select 
 the marker on the map and select "Set Destination" and you'll get a trail 
 to it.

Q: Can I get quickly around Middle-earth?

A: Yes!  Whenever you discover a new Map Stone, you can fast travel to it 
 almost whenever you want to by going to the map and selecting it.  Certain 
 story points won't allow this in order to keep parties separated.

Q: How can I pull open orange handles?  No one in the game can!

A: There are two ways.  One is via an orc character.  Shagrat is a character 
 you get for free after Cirith Ungol.  The other way is via the item called 
 "Mithril Boxing Gloves", the design for which is found in Osgiliath.

Q: How can I get rid of shiny mithril bricks blocking the path?

A: You need some form of explosives.  You can either buy the Berserker orc, 
 who shows up in Helm's Deep after you complete that mission, or you can 
 forge Mithril Fireworks, the design for which is found in the hub just 
 outside Barad-dûr.

Q: How can I change the time of day?

A: After completing the Story, pick any Map Stone and select to travel to 
 it.  You'll be able to select a time of day as well.

================
3C. Hints/Tips =
================

My first advice is to go through the story before you seriously attempt to 
collect objects.  The game kinda railroads you and cuts you off from 
important characters while going through the story, so just relax and enjoy 
and worry about collecting stuff later.

Smash freakin' everything.  Lay waste to any LEGO objects in the area and 
rack up that stud total.  Use Ground Pounds to demolish clusters of objects 
quickly.

Keep collecting studs.  Collecting a specified number in each mission will 
give you "True Adventurer" status at the conclusion of it.  Once you hit the 
threshold, you cannot lose it, no matter how low your studs gets afterwards.

Explore everywhere.  Run into walls and behind them to look for any areas 
you might be missing.  Big value studs are hidden in places where you can't 
normally see them.

Look out for visual cues to see how you can progress in a mission.  Look for 
soft glows next to dirt piles where Sam can dig, for example, or floating 
leaves for where elves are expected to jump.

Collect Minikit Chests to assemble a little piece of Middle-earth.  While 
you can't use these, they can be viewed in a special room in Rivendell.  For 
completing a Minikit, you'll get 50,000 studs, except for the last one, 
which gives you 500,000.

There are many things around Middle-earth for you to find, including Mithril 
Bricks, Side Quests, and Blacksmith Designs.  Keep an eye on the map for 
things to look for and don't be discouraged if you can't get to them right 
away.  You'll be able to later.

"I was there two thousand years ago, when the strength of Men failed." 
 - Elrond

True Adventurer at 30,000

Characters: Elendil, Isildur, Elrond (Second Age)

---

Walkthrough - 

The Battle of Dagorlad -
 Well, this is quite the epic battle, isn't it?  Don't worry too much about 
 all the hullabaloo that's going on around you.  All the fighting is just 
 to box you into one area so you can fight other guys.  Orcs will pop into 
 the area and your objective is to defeat five orcs with banners on their 
 backs.  After you defeat those five, another few orcs standard-bearers will 
 show up, but these ones have shields, and you basically have to hammer the 
 Square button to knock their shields away, then beat them down.  Once 
 those three are down, Mount Doom will erupt, and a few evil looking spires 
 will pop out of the ground.  These are Morgul blocks.  Remember them for 
 later.  All you need to know for now is to slash them with Narsil, 
 Elendil's sword, then take out the orcs.

The Dark Lord -
 Oh man.  That guy... is TALL.  So, all you really have to do to fight 
 Sauron is avoid his attacks and wait for him to slam and get his mace 
 stuck in the ground.  Hack at it with Narsil, and bust it three times.

Climbing the Slopes -
 First, note the nearby statue.  That's a Save Statue, and allows you to 
 resume this mission from this spot and quit the game if you wish.  Head 
 to the right across the rocks.  Jump to the rails on the walls to hang 
 from them, and move along them, jumping up to the next ones.  Once you 
 climb up, hack through the Morgul blocks with Isildur, then head further 
 to the right.  Time your movement past the jets spewing out steam, then 
 continue through the Morgul blocks to the back.  Jump up onto the 
 rails and cross to the other side.

 Once you're safely on the far shore, hack up the Morgul blocks to drop a 
 wooden plank that you can climb.  Press Triangle to swap to Elrond.  At the 
 top, note the leaf-like icon.  That means a high jumper will be used here.  
 Have Elrond hop up to the ledge, then head right and push the rock into 
 the lava, allowing Isildur to cross.

 Continue further to the right, climbing up the rails, until you reach 
 the large gate.  Kill all the orcs here and eventually the doors will 
 open.  Once they open, you can head inside.

The Cracks of Doom -
 Not much to do hear but knock down the orcs in your way and head for the 
 edge to the toss the Ring in!  Right?  RIGHT?

Middle-earth Interlude: 

New Characters: Frodo, Sam

Welcome to Middle-earth, dear friends.  A huge open-world that you can, 
mostly, freely explore.  If you wish to wander, you can do so, but you 
won't be able to get too much done.  Still, it's nice to soak in some Shire 
culture.  I also suggest hitting that glowing statue.  That's a Map Stone, 
which will illuminate all hidden items in the area.  Each new area has one.

So, to continue with the story, follow the Guide Studs (faint blue studs) 
down the trail to Farmer Maggot's.

4B. The Black Rider =
=====================

"Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!" - Sam

True Adventurer at 16,000

Characters: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf the Grey

---

Walkthrough - 

The Rider -
 Well, this is a new setup for LEGO games.  You're now in "sneak" mode, 
 where instead of jumping, pressing X will do a roll.  Your objective, if 
 that wasn't obvious, is to stay out of sight.  The Rider's "vision" is 
 represented by light shining through the branches, and you'll need to 
 repeatedly distract it to move forward.

 Head to the right and smash the first LEGO rock you see.  A smaller rock 
 will pop out of it.  Pick up the glowing rock and hold down Square to 
 target your throw.  Focus on the bird to the right and release to toss it.  
 Alternatively, while facing to the right, simply pressing Square will 
 likely get the job done.  The Rider will be distracted and move on, 
 allowing you to continue.

 At the next stopping point, switch to Sam and note the dirt pile on the 
 ground.  Hold Circle to have Sam dig up a rock, then toss it at the 
 boulder to roll it.  Continue on.  Now the Rider is moving back and forth.  
 Time your movement, hiding behind the center tree, and move on.

 Now you're a small stream, and there's a crawlspace near you.  Press 
 Circle to enter it and go up to the branches, then walk out onto them to 
 disturb the bird.  Head back down and continue.  As you cross the river, 
 you'll come across another dirt pile with a plant sticking out of it.  
 Again, with Sam, press Circle next to it to grow the plant.  This will 
 block the Rider's sight of you, allowing you to proceed.

Orthanc -
 But enough of that!  It's time to see what Gandalf is up to visiting 
 Saruman.  Things aren't going well for the Grey Pilgrim.  Note that at this 
 point you have access to both Gandalf and the Hobbits.  If you have a 
 second player, they will be with the Hobbits while the other is with 
 Gandalf.  If playing alone, you can still play as the Hobbits, but you 
 won't be able to proceed until you finish dealing with Saruman.

 Repel Saruman's attack using Square, then, once you can move again, move 
 around and hop to avoid his attacks.  Once Saruman tires, hold Circle while 
 near him to lift him up.  Toss him into anything to weaken him.  You'll 
 have to do this three times.

The Rider (Part 2) -
 Back to the boys, you'll need to smash some of the bushes and rocks 
 nearby to find three pieces of floor tile.  You can place these in your 
 inventory, then drop them on the tile floor near the boulder.  When all 
 three are placed, you can push the boulder over the edge and distract the 
 Rider again.

 Further on, you'll have to throw an apple twice more.  At the tree to 
 the right, and then the owl who sits on its branches.  Grow a plant at the 
 right edge and you'll be able to climb the rock behind you and over the 
 big log.

 A second water crossing.  Head towards the screen (to the foreground) to 
 find a LEGO jetty.  These can be fished at, but you need a pole.  Turns 
 out Merry has one, so switch to him and press Circle near the water to 
 start fishing.  Press the button prompts that come up.  You get a bonus if 
 you press the button as the string circle touches the button.  You'll pull 
 up a crab.  Fling it at the far side of the water to light the bridge on 
 fire.

 On the right-hand shore is another dig pile.  Dig it up to find another 
 rock.  Throw it at the hive of bees.  That'll learn him.  Head where the 
 web used to be, then head right to crawl through the hollow log.  You 
 have one more distraction to do, and it won't be ready unless you have 
 finished with Gandalf earlier.  Pick up the apple and toss it, then 
 follow the sign.

The Chase -
 There's not much to this part except enjoy the run and try to avoid the 
 riders.

Middle-earth Interlude: 

Follow the stud trail into Bree.  Note that it's nighttime now.  Certain 
collectibles can only be found at night, and one only at daytime.  I  
wouldn't worry about that, for now, though.  Head east towards Bree and 
into town.  Head for the Prancing Pony and you'll find some fellow just 
standing there outside.  Talk to him.  Seems he wants a Mithril Trowel.  

This is one of many Side Quests in the game, where you'll have to bring 
a person an item and they'll reward you in return.  In this case, not only 
is this guy offering you passage into the inn, but a Red Brick as well.  
This is the only quest you need to complete as part of the story

Head to the Blacksmith and pick up the Design in front of him, conveniently 
enough, for the Mithril Trowel.  Head to the left and press Circle to 
access his menu.  Pick the Trowel and spend your two Mithril Bricks to 
get it made, then go back to the man and press Circle to give it to him.  
You may purchase the Red Brick now if you wish, or just go inside the Inn.

NOTE: Not only have you given the Trowel, but you still technically "have" 
it in your Treasure Trove.  Hold down Circle and select the Trove and 
pick the Trowel and whichever character you're controlling will equip it.  
Through this, you can have anyone use it, as long as you're in Free Play or 
exploring Middle-earth.

You know have Aragorn leading the group.  Feeling mighty, yet?  Head 
north out of town, east through the swamp, then up to Weathertop.

 knows about them, doesn't he?" - Pippin

Walkthrough - 

Hillside -
 Note that Pippin and Merry have Barrow-blades, and Sam decided he prefers 
 his trusty Frying Pan.  


 We have some hungry Hobbits, so let's make them a meal!  First, let's build 
 a fire.  You'll need to gather three clumps of LEGO wood.  They are found 
 in faintly glowing bushes, like the one near the back next to the tree, 
 the one in the foreground, and one up on a ledge above.  To get to that 
 last one, smash the rock above the crawlspace to find the tiles to assemble 
 the push floor so you can push the other rock out of the way.

 While you're up on the ledge, may as well shimmy along the rail to the 
 right.  Hit the bird's nest and you'll knock out an egg.  Note that it's 
 kinda glowing purple.  That means it's supposed to be combined with 
 something.  In this case, Sam's Frying Pan.  You can trade items by 
 tossing them with Circle if someone else picks up the egg.  Now, for two 
 more food items.  Dig near the plant to grow a tomato plant, then knock a 
 tomato off and place it on the Frying Pan, too.  Lastly, have Merry fish 
 to get a kipper, then put that on the Frying Pan.  Once you have all the 
 wood in place, have Sam press Circle next to the fire to light it with 
 his Tinderbox (Man, Sam can do EVERYTHING).  Place the whole meal on 
 the fire.

Climb to the Top -
 The food sadly interrupted, we now need to get to the top of the hill.  
 Head left and smash up all the brush to find pieces to make a bridge.  Cross 
 it, then have Sam use the plant.  You'll get a couple rocks out of the 
 deal.  Toss them at the scrub to the left to clear a way to cross.  Another 
 plant awaits you at the end.  Use it to bounce up to the next ledge.  Use 
 the crawlspace there to head to find a pile of sticks.  Assemble them, 
 then light them with Sam to clear the way.

 Now, avoid that nasty-looking bramble patch and head up to the left.  Have 
 two characters hang from the two vines.  This will drop pieces that you 
 can assemble into a plank to cross the brambles.  Head up the slope and 
 chop a bush to make another piles of sticks that Sam can burn, which will 
 clear off the wall so you can climb up the rails.  Head down to the right 
 and dig up yet another plant.  Hop across it to the right, then head up 
 the stairs in the back.

Amon Sul -
 So, you've got Sam and Frodo against a gaggle of Ringwraiths.  Fortunately, 
 their hearts don't seem into it, as they're just kinda stalking around 
 taking a few potshots.  Frodo is invisible in the "twilight world".  This 
 means he can interact with pieces that are lit up white.  What you need to 
 do is light five fires in the area: 
 1. In the center of the area.
 2. In the back.  Smash apart the wagon and assemble the pieces.
 3. On the right side of the area.  Have Frodo put the pieces together.
 4. In the back right, push the statue off the push floor, then have Frodo 
  put the pieces together.
 5. On the left side, dig up the plant, then smash the bush and assemble the 
  pieces.
 Careful, because if you put together a pile of sticks and leave it, it's 
 possible that the Ringwraiths will smash them apart.

 Once all five fires are lit, Aragorn shows up to help, and it's now 
 Aragorn and Sam with torches.  You've only got one fire left, but you'll 
 need torches to smack the Ringwraiths with fire.  Immediately hit the first 
 one with your lit torch.  Sam has a second, so build the nearby fire, light 
 up the torch, and hit another wraith.  You'll need to find three more 
 torches.  There are rocks on the ground.  Pick one up, and you'll see 
 arrows pointing to where to throw them.  The torches are here, so knock 
 one loose, pick it up, light it, and burn a wraith.  Repeat until they're 
 all gone.

Middle-earth Interlude: 

New Characters: Arwen Evenstar (Ranger)

Frodo's been stabbed, and needs to get to Rivendell.  Take Arwen and cross 
the water to the east.  Once the cutscene is complete and the Ringwraiths 
get their bath, head up to Rivendell.  After the next cutscene, head down 
to the pavilion where the Council of Elrond is taking place.  The Fellowship 
of the Ring will now form.  Frodo will get a new weapon in "Sting", as well 
as a mithril shirt which will protect him from damage.

Head south from Rivendell and note that the path is leading you over water.  
Switch to Legolas and aim his bow at the target on the rocks, then at the 
next two that appear.  Hop across the rocks you've now moved into your path, 
then follow the trail south to...

 Grey, Boromir

Walkthrough - 

Cliffside -
 You're going to have to deal with snow drifts as you cross the pass.  Short 
 characters: Gimli and the Hobbits, cannot cross without being carried by 
 a taller character, or by being tossed.  Press Circle to pick up a small 
 character, and then Square to toss them to another tall character.  So, you 
 can do either to get Gimli across the first drift.

 Gimli's special deal is that he can smash cracked blocks, such as the one 
 here.  Press Square in front of it, then head through the crawlspace.  
 Jump and press Square to slam the cracked block on the floor, then head 
 back up to join the rest of the Fellowship, who can now make it across 
 easily.  Now, switch back to a tall character, pick Gimli up again, and 
 throw him at the cracked block high on the wall.  You're now sufficiently 
 trained in cracking.  Good job.

 Climb up the rails to the left and push the rock into your path so everyone 
 can climb up.  Now, head right through another snow drift.  Have Gimli 
 bust up the block, go through the crawlspace, and smash the next block 
 to remove this snow drift as well.  Continue to the right, smashing more 
 cracked blocks to clear the way.  As you continue, you'll hit upon some 
 targets.  Use Legolas to shoot them down so you can proceed across the 
 rail.

 You now have a campsite here, and you'll have to get wood into the fire 
 pit.  The three crates in this area have the wood you need.  Have Sam 
 light it up, which will melt the ice around you, allowing you to assemble 
 a ballista.  Hop in with Triangle and press Square to fire it at the fare 
 end.  Cross the rope with Legolas, then fire arrows back to the left so 
 you can stick your arrows in the holes.  These create poles that let you 
 swing across, so just flip over to the left, then shoot the target near 
 the winch to move a rope so everyone can climb up.

 Grab Gimli and toss him at the cracked block, then head over the next 
 drift with Gimli so he can go up the crawlspace and smash some more.  
 This will allow everyone to cross, including Sam, who can assemble the 
 sticks and set fire to them to remove the ice.  Head to the right past the 
 rockfall.  Toss Gimli again to the other side of the gap.

 Another snow drift.  This time, bring Sam across and have him dig up the 
 crawlspace, then have Gimli go through and smash again.  While this 
 removes the drift behind you, you still need a way to move forward.  Bring 
 Sam down to the lower level and have him dig up the pieces of a plank.  
 Walk across it, head up the ledges and to another campsite.  Smash it up 
 to find three more pieces of wood, stack, and light them.  Then, dig up 
 the plant you uncovered.  Everyone should be able to cross now.

 Almost done!  Have Legolas shoot the targets to the right, then assemble 
 the cracked block, throw Gimli at it, and continue on down the path. 

Westgate of Moria -
 Well, that didn't work so well.  Time to try the Moria route.  You'll need 
 to open the door first.  You'll need three characters to do so:
 Gimli: Go to the right, smash through the cracked block, and crawl 
  through.  Smash the tower to drop it so you can climb up, then head left 
  and smash the minecart to get pieces for a push panel.  Tap Circle 
  repeatedly next to it to push the tree around, then head further left and 
  smash the cracked block.  Assemble the pieces of the door.
 Legolas: Head to the left and shoot an arrow at the hole.  Hop up to the 
  ledges and flip across.  Continue up the rocks and to the right, flipping 
  across another pole.  At the end, push the rock off the ledge and 
  assemble the pieces.
 Sam: Dig up the area in front of the door.  Three pieces of wood again.  
  They are in two minecarts in the area, and in the small wooden dock.  
  Smash, collect, place, and light them.

Watcher in the Water -
 Someone doesn't want you disturbing the water.  Your first objective is to 
 chop up some tentacles.  When one lunges and gets stuck, slash it up.  Do 
 this for four tentacles, then the Watcher's main body will appear.  First, 
 fling Gimli at the beast, then shoot it in the face.  Do this once more 
 to free Frodo.

Walkthrough - 

Balin's Tomb -
 You need to get Pippin out of the well.  First, smash the boxes on either 
 side of the well and assemble the pieces.  Next, go to the right, shoot 
 the target, then have Sam burn down the wood in the area to get a key to 
 open the chest.  Take the cog in there and place it next to the mechanism.  
 Lastly, go to the left and smash the cracked block, take the crank, and 
 place it.  Turn the crank.

Drums in the Deep -
 You'll need to block the door in readiness to receive the orc horde.  First, 
 assemble the two spear parts on the sides.  Next, have Legolas shoot the 
 targets on either side holding the chains up.  Have two characters grab the 
 chains together to lower the bar.  Unfortunately, they will not hold, so 
 defeat any and all orcs that come through the doors.

Cave Troll -
 After fighting several orcs, this guy will show up.  

 Now, assemble the little brown platform near you.  These are meant to lure 
 the Troll so it strikes that specific spot.  Stand on it and wait for him 
 to roar, which means he's going for that spot.  Move out of the way and 
 he'll bonk himself.  Now, switch to Legolas and head up to either side.  
 Smash a rock in order to uncover another platform for the Troll, then 
 bait him with it.  He'll get his chain stuck, so hop out onto it and shoot 
 him in the face.  Do the same thing for the other side of the room.

 Now, you've got a Hobbit on the Troll hacking away.  Once you bang on him 
 enough, he'll be stunned.  Switch to Legolas and shoot him.  Now, the 
 rubble you made earlier can be assembled into crawlspaces.  Take the 
 Hobbit to either side of the room and go up the crawlspace, stand in the 
 glowing circle, then press Circle to jump back on the Troll and bang on 
 him again.  You'll shoot him with another arrow.  Do the same for the other 
 side of the room and you'll be done.

Halls of Durin -
 This first part is simple.  While Gandalf holds off the majority of the 
 orcs, you need to take out the stragglers that get in.  Take out three 
 groups of them.  Once he removes his shield, head to the left to find a 
 door.

 To get it open, everyone needs to work together.  Pippin now carries the 
 bucket he got from the tomb, so fill it up at the nearby water pool and 
 dump it on the fire.  Have Gandalf use his magic to pick up the purple 
 cog and place it on the wall.  Have Gimli smash the cracked block and 
 assemble the pieces, then push the mechanism into the wall.  Lastly, the 
 crank can be found beneath the barrel in the left corner.  Place it and 
 turn it, then head through the door.

Bridge of Khazad-dûm -
 Run down the stairs.  After a short walk, the bridge will break, splitting 
 up the party.  First, toss Gimli to the left onto the cracked block.  This 
 will unearth a crawlspace.  Have Sam enter it, then cross over to the right 
 pillar and burn it down.  This will compress the pillars, allowing Legolas 
 to cross to the left and shoot down the targets, allowing the party to 
 proceed.

The Balrog -
 This area is split, like back in "The Black Rider".  Gandalf's portion needs 
 to be finished first, and he isn't letting the Balrog get away without a 
 fight, so hold down X to dive down to the demon and hammer on Square to 
 slash it.  Press Circle when the prompt comes up to stab him.  You'll need 
 to do this three times, but the Balrog will start breathing fire at you 
 on the subsequent tries, so you'll have to hop left and right to avoid his 
 breath.

 Once the Balrog is out of the picture, we're back to the rest of the party.  
 Head up the stairs and have Legolas shoot the target, and then the arrow 
 into the hole so he can flip across it.  Have Gimli smash the cracked block 
 and escape.

Head down the path to Lothlórien.  Frodo will now have the Phial of Galadriel, 
which allows him to light up dark places, as well as an Elven Cloak, which 
allows him to become invisible.  Sam will now have the Elven Rope, and 
Legolas will get the Bow of the Galadhrim, which isn't much better than his 
regular bow, but still, kinda nice.

So, tap on Square to push yourself down the river.  You'll start the next 
mission when you reach the end.

Walkthrough - 

Hillside -
 We have another party split here.  You have Frodo going solo with the 
 Ring on as he tries to avoid Boromir, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli 
 trying to catch up.  Let's focus on Frodo first.

 The idea here is similar to "The Black Rider".  You have to distract 
 Boromir so he runs off so you can proceed.  He can't see you, but if you 
 run into the piles of leaves he's standing in, he'll hear you.

 So, grab the nearby rock, head up the hill, and toss it at the targeted 
 spot.  Continue up the path and head into the crawlspace.  From here, 
 push the pillar off the edge, then assemble the pieces.  Climb the stairs 
 and punch a nearby rock to get a small rock to throw at the big stone 
 hand.  Assemble the pieces and walk above Boromir.  Punch the objects 
 on the pillars to knock them down in succession, then continue until 
 you see an obviously LEGO tree.  Smash it and the objects nearby and 
 assemble the catapult.  Punch it to fling the rock, then continue further 
 up the path.  Grab the rock and toss it above Boromir to move him 
 further.  Next, punch a rock to get a small rock, and toss it back to 
 the left to the obvious glowing white parts.  Assemble them, climb the 
 stairs, and push the pillar off the edge.  This next one is the last one.  
 Head into the crawlspace, punch a rock, grab the small rock and toss it 
 at the arch above Boromir.  This will allow you clearance to run up the 
 slope to the top, ending Frodo's portion.

 Now, let's deal with Aragorn and co.  A tree has fallen in your way out 
 of the landing.  You'll need a torch, and you can find one in the oars on 
 the ground.  Pick it up, light it at the fire, then set it down near the 
 tree to burn it out of your way.  Have Legolas go up the path, jump up to 
 the vine, and shoot down the target so you can assemble a springboard so 
 the other two can jump up the ledge.  Further ahead is a cracked block for 
 Gimli.

 In the next area, you'll have to move some pillars to advance.  Throw Gimli 
 at the cracked block, have Legolas shoot an arrow into the hole, then hop 
 up to the top and push the pillar off the edge.  Smash the cracked block 
 near the tile floor, then assemble the other pillar and arrange them so 
 you have steps up.

 In the next area, you'll need to ascend some more.  Smash all the cracked 
 blocks and assemble all the pieces.  Legolas will have to shoot another 
 arrow into a hole to flip up, then assemble a small pillar and push it off 
 so the rest can join you.

 Now it's time for Aragorn to shine.  Pick up Sting on the ground.  Note the 
 green haze that's coming off it.  That means that Aragorn can use it to 
 track with his super-ranger skills.  You'll see green footprints on the 
 ground.  Follow them to the nearby bush.  You'll know you're getting close 
 when Aragorn starts crawling.  The tracking ends when he starts digging at 
 the ground.

Uruk-hai Attack -
 Sending Frodo away, the Terrific Trio engages the Uruk-hai.  Your objective 
 is to take down the ones hanging up in high places, and you can do that by 
 either shooting them or smashing the pillars supporting them.  Once you've 
 killed your share, more will come in, bursting through the log to the 
 south.

 Head south and engage more uruks.  Smash down the pillars and shoot the 
 ones that you can't smash down.  Once you've cleared the area, you'll be 
 able to continue to the east.  Take down more uruks.  Make sure you toss 
 Gimli at the cracked block so you can run up the ramp and engage the 
 remaining uruks.

Departure of Boromir -
 The fight is now against Lurtz, the captain of this troop.  You'll have 
 Boromir, Merry, and Pippin to fight against him with.  Unfortunately, that 
 leaves you with no ranged combat, so you'll have to send a Hobbit up the 
 crawlspace to swat Lurtz to take off one heart.  For the next heart, just 
 smash the rocks in the way of the crawlspace and hit him again.  For the 
 last heart, you'll need to go to the right, assemble the pieces into a 
 springboard, then launch a Hobbit up to Lurtz.

 Now it's Aragorn and Boromir vs. Lurtz.  This part is simple.  Avoid 
 Lurtz's attacks, watch for when he throws his shield, and smack him when 
 he goes to retrieve it.  After a few hearts, he'll just fight you straight, 
 so take out the last of his hearts to finish.  If he grabs you, switch 
 characters and have the other hit him.

Walkthrough - 

Battle of the Peak -
 Another party split, and this time I'm going to separate them.  This is 
 Gandalf's portion where he gives the Balrog the business.  Head up the 
 slope and smash the ice around the colored blocks.  You'll want to assemble 
 these blocks using Gandalf's magic into stairs, or just stack a couple and 
 keep going.  Head further up to the tower, then build and smash your way 
 up the steps to the apex.

 To defeat the Balrog, avoid his attacks and wait for lightning to begin 
 striking.  Stand under the lightning's focus and press Circle to focus it 
 on the Balrog.  You'll need to hit him three times.  First on his wings, 
 then on his chest.  That will smite his ruin on the mountainside for sure.

Circular Path -
 Now to something slightly less epic.  Gollum takes the fish out of the 
 nearby basket and runs off.  You'll need to fill that basket with six 
 fish in order to proceed.  This is done as follows:
 1. Directly in front of you.
 2. Is dislodged once Gandalf defeats the Balrog.
 3. Head to the right, stand under the glowing line and press Circle so 
  Sam uses his Elven Rope to pull himself up.  Smash the scrub, assemble 
  the ladder, and climb up to reach this fish.
 4. Head further right.  Note the really dark cavern.  Walk in with Frodo 
  and he'll pull out his phial.  You can have Sam follow and dig up the fish 
  inside.
 5. Head further right.  Have Sam plant near the tile floor, then push the 
  pillar to the other end so you can climb up the plant and hop across.  
  Now, if the fish weren't enough, you have to assemble a fire using three 
  pieces of wood.  One is behind the rocks on the left.  Another is in the 
  scrub at the foreground, and the last is beneath the scrub to the right.
  Light the fire and climb up to the fish.
 6. Keep going right.  Smash a pile of rocks and scrub to find a dig pile, 
  which will have pieces of a rope hook beneath.  Assemble them, then climb 
  up to the next ledge.  Have Sam plant to create a flower so Frodo can 
  join you on the ledge, then have Frodo go through the crawlspace and into 
  the dark cavern to get the last fish.
 With that done, keep going right and push the rock off the edge to find 
 that you're back at the beginning.  Throw all your fish into the basket to 
 create a new passage to the back.

Gollum -
 Gollum is still not quite ready to play ball, yet.  The idea is to give 
 fish to him to occupy him, allowing Sam to use his rope on Gollum, and 
 for Frodo to smack him to knock off a heart.  That was the easy one.  Now 
 you'll need to find more fish, and the only way to do that is by fishing, 
 but you have no pole.

 So, let's make a pole.  First, head into the dark cave on the back wall 
 to find a fishing line.  Have Sam dig at the nearby dig pile to find a 
 gold hook for his rope.  Attach it to the wall, then pull down the rock 
 to find a fishing hook.  Combine the two, then go up the small path on 
 the left and have Sam rope himself up to the scrub at the ledge.  Smash 
 it to find the pole.  Combine all three, then fish at the dock.  Note that 
 this Fishing Pole will now go into your Treasure Trove, meaning you can 
 pull it out later in Middle-earth or during Free Play at any time, with 
 any person.  Anyway, once you get your fish, throw it at Gollum again, 
 then do it one more time.

Middle-earth Interlude: 

Okay, now you might notice you have another party in the upper-right corner.  
Yes, that's Aragorn and co., and you can switch to them whenever you want 
and do their story missions, or you can continue on with Frodo and Sam.  
For the purpose of this guide, and because this is how things are ordered 
in the game, we're going stay with Frodo and follow Gollum down into...

Walkthrough - 

Marsh -
 Get ready to be annoyed because for some reason, Gollum will not shut up 
 about following him.  Gollum will hop through the water, leaving a 
 brown trail behind him.  This is the safe part of the bog to walk through, 
 so follow him.  In his second move, Gollum will move through water, and 
 fire will spring up behind him.  You'll need to put out this fire.  Have 
 Sam dig up the pile to find a Wooden Bucket, which you will save as a 
 Treasure.  Fill it with the blue water in the nearby pool and throw it on 
 the fire to continue.

 For the next fire, head left and dig up the plant, then climb up and light 
 the tree on fire so it fills the pool to the left.  Fill it, douse the 
 fire, and continue.  For the third fire, go to the right and step on the 
 bones to lift up another set of planks to the right.  Fill, then douse.

 For fire #4, go north to the island with a button on it.  Stand on it to 
 keep the water filled, then have the other character use the bucket on it.
 For fire #5, use the rope at a hook to the northwest, then cross, enter 
 the ribcage, and use the rope inside to raise up the bones.  Cross the 
 bones to reach the next pool of water.

 For fire #6 (and this is the last one), head to the hollowed out tree in 
 the back, enter the dark part of it with Frodo, and smash it to find pieces 
 for a hook that Sam can pull down to release the water into the pool.

Wraiths with Wings -
 Now we have a sneak and peek section.  You'll have to hide when Gollum 
 tells you to, so have Sam hop into the stump, and have Frodo select his 
 Elven Cloak.  Wait for the Nazgûl to pass you, and then move on when 
 Gollum says to.  You'll do this about four times.  The fifth time, they 
 mix it up a bit.  You have to get inside the dark stump as Frodo so Sam 
 can join you in there.  

 The next area requires sneaking, which means no jumping.  Use Sam's rope 
 on the obvious hook hanging overhead and head up the little slope so you 
 drop onto the seesaw that lets Frodo head further right and smash up the 
 tree so both characters can proceed.  At the next stopover, burn the 
 tree, then hide as normal, then move on.  In the last area, use Sam's rope 
 to reveal pieces for a bridge, cross, then dig up the plant at the end, 
 hop up and escape.

The Wilds -
 Suddenly, you're in control of Faramir, and it's time to dispose of some 
 oliphaunts, or mumakil, as the Haradrim call them.  Grab onto the hanging 
 rope of either mumakil and climb up to the carriage at the top.  Pick up 
 the rope and use it to climb to the very top, where you can knock out the 
 driver and scare the beast off.  Do the same with the other mumakil.

Middle-earth Interlude: 

You now have Faramir on your team, and he'll be taking you to Osgiliath.  
There's just one problem.  There's a big red haze around Osgiliath.  It's 
Sauron's gaze, and you cannot enter while his gaze is upon any area.  This 
is the game's way of getting you to finish both paths before moving on.  
This means we need to switch to the other team.

So, with Aragorn's team, head to the marker to begin the next mission.

Walkthrough - 

Uruk Pyre -
 Begin by firing at the targets on the pyre, then assemble the shields into 
 stairs and have Gimli slam the block.  You'll now have to track the belt 
 to find what happened to Merry and Pippin.  You'll also find a second 
 tracking item, which leads to a rock.  Assemble the rope hook on the rock, 
 then go left and use Legolas to bring down the target and the rope, which 
 you can use on the rock to get a new tracking item.  Keep following 
 multiple tracking items to continue into Fangorn Forest.

Fangorn Forest -
 Now we get to see what happened to Merry and Pippin.  Head to the right.  
 Smash up the rocks and go down the slope, then have both characters grab 
 the log further to the right to pull it down.  Assemble the pieces, climb 
 up, head to the right, and fight more orcs until some jump down and clear 
 away the crawlspace.  Crawl up, then clear away the brush between the 
 two big LEGO trees, and assemble it into rails.  Climb up the rails.

Treebeard -
 Now you have the massive power of Treebeard on your side, and you can 
 literally walk all over the orcs in this area.  Head to the right and 
 back.  Use Circle to pick up a boulder and Square to throw it at the 
 back wall to knock it down so you can continue.  Pick Merry up and carry 
 him across the water.  Keep moving until a flaming log blocks your path.  
 Put Merry down, then switch to him so he can head up the crawlspace and 
 pull on the vine to release water onto the fire.  Continue up the path 
 to the rear to finish.

 You need to draw Saruman from Théoden.  Beat up all the guards in the

 Théoden to remove the gray hearts from him.  Grima will push you away, so 
 beat up more guards and assemble a cage.  The idea is to now hit Grima 
 again so he starts running around and is eventually trapped in the cage.  
 Then, you're safe to focus on Théoden some more.  Do that twice more to 
 free the King.

The Riddermark -
 There are two ways to take out Warg Riders.  Either you have to be on a

 their sides and drag them off.  Either way, take out all the Wargs that 
 come at you.

Walkthrough - 

The Deeping Wall -
 The battle hasn't even started and already we're stuck down at the bottom 
 of the wall.  First, have Legolas shoot the target on the left, then 
 place the cogs on the wall.  Smash the cracked block, pick up the crank, 
 and attach it to the mechanism so you can turn it.  Hop up the boxes and 
 stairs, smash the cracked block near the top, and climb the rest of the 
 way up.

The First Advance -
 You need to repel ladders that hit the wall.  Some ladders require Legolas 
 to shoot the orc at the top.  Some require Gimli to smash a cracked 
 block.  Others can just be slashed at.  Take out three ladders, then four 
 will come up.  Have Gimli go to the far right and go through the crawlspace 
 and push out a box to take down the far right ladder.  Next is five 
 ladders, taken out the same way.

The Wall Breached -
 Smash the cracked block to your left and assemble the pieces, then hop up 
 with Legolas and smash the spear rack so you can assemble a hole for an 
 arrow.  Flip up to the left, push the rock off, then hop up and continue 
 to the left.  Smash the cracked block to remove the wall so you can move 
 on to the keep.

The Hornburg - 
 In case you were wondering, yes, that was Peter Jackson throwing his 
 Academy Award at the orcs (he was in the same place in the movie).  Anyway, 
 throw Gimli to the left to break the ram.  Take out the orcs in the area, 
 then assemble a timber for the gate.  At this point, you'll switch to 
 Legolas.  Have him shoot down the ladders on the left, then smash up the 
 big ladder when it comes up.  Assemble the pieces into a tile floor, then 
 push the box down to the bottom.  Assemble the pieces and hop onto the 
 rope to climb up.

Walkthrough - 

Battle of Osgiliath -
 We have another split-up here.  This time, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are in 
 the far part of the area, while Faramir is trapped in the near part, and 
 the two have to help each other move forward.

 Have Frodo head up the crawlspace, then switch to Faramir.  Fire an arrow 
 at the distant target (you'll be doing a lot of that, so get used to it), 
 then move to the right.  Switch to Frodo and hop across the pillar.  Drop 
 down and have Sam pull down the rope hook.  Switch back to Faramir and have 
 him use the pieces that just appeared to finish the tile floor so he can 
 arrange the pillars and climb up so he can shoot the target to open the 
 gate.  Have Frodo move inside the gate, then have Faramir shoot the *other* 
 target to open the far right gate so they all can get through.

 Now, you'll note an orc in the tower.  He has a sword that you'll need to 
 cut Gollum's bonds.  Go into the dark spot behind you with Frodo and smash 
 the objects so you can build a crawlspace to climb up.  Once the tower is 
 ruined, rope the hook above you and bounce up.  Switch back to Faramir.  
 Take out the orcs, including the one shooting at you from above, then 
 assemble the ladder, climb, and shoot the target in the tower.  Switch to 
 Sam, assemble the ladder, climb up and take the sword.  Hop down and press 
 Circle next to Gollum.  You now have full control of the little bugger, and 
 can climb up the LEGO wall marked with fish bones.

 Turn the crank at the top of the wall to open the gate for the Hobbitses, 
 then head down the stairs to the right.  Switch back to Faramir and head 
 down to the right.  Climb the stairs in the back and shoot the two targets 
 flanking the statue.  Assemble the pieces and push the statue to the left, 
 the fire at the orcs flinging barrels Donkey Kong-style.  Now, Gollum can 
 safely climb up the wall to the top and push the statue back down to the 
 left.  Have Sam clear out the rubble and plant a flower to bounce up to 
 the upper area, where he can burn away the wood so they can continue.

 Whoa, Nazgûl!  You'll have to use Faramir to repel the flying beast so the 
 other crew can proceed.  Switch back to him and head to the right, smashing 
 the wood so you can get a clear shot.  Once you fire on it, have Sam go 
 down the stairs and dig up the gears for the mechanism.  You still need the 
 crank though.  Fortunately, Gollum can fish without a pole, so smash the 
 rocks in front of the jetty and have him pull up a crank.  Head on 
 through.  Switch back to Faramir so he can head right.  Orcs will burst 
 through the wall, giving him a clear shot again.  Fire, then head to the 
 right, assembling the pieces for a ladder, then climbing up.  Head to the 
 right with Frodo, smash the pillars, and assemble them into stairs.  Climb 
 up for the last Nazgûl sighting.  Fire at him with Faramir.

Battle of Isengard -
 Now we have two Ents versus Isengard.  If that sounds like fun to you, 
 then start wrecking the place.  Head to the right and eventually you'll 
 come to a gap that you'll need to knock a tower over to create a bridge.  
 Continue until you hit a wall of fire.  Grab the nearby water tower and 
 toss it at the fire, then continue back towards the dam.  Throw rocks at 
 the towers near the dam so you can climb up, then pull on the supports to 
 release it.

Walkthrough - 

Minas Morgul -
 You'll need to keep an eye on Frodo here, because he sometimes gets drawn 
 out to Minas Morgul.  Controlling him will keep that from happening.  
 Anyway, to the left of the statues flanking the road to Minas Morgul is a 
 dark cave.  Send Frodo in and have Sam follow so he can dig up the spot 
 and assemble the pieces underneath.  Push the statue to reveal a hook for 
 the rope and pull it down.  Assemble the next pieces and burn them.  The 
 pieces you have now can be used to put together some of the stairs.  That's 
 one part.  We need another part of the stairs.

 Head to the left in the foreground to find a wall that Gollum can crawl 
 up.  Smash the boulder of the edge so Sam can get up, dig up the pile, 
 assemble the pieces and use his rope to pull down the plants.  Cross the 
 gap with Frodo, enter the dark cave to find tiles for the push floor.  Push 
 the rock off the edge and assemble the pieces into the rest of the stairs, 
 then head on up.

The Stairs -
 Climb up and head to the right, jumping over the gaps and using the rails 
 to shimmy over.  Climb up the stairs some more.  In this next area, enter 
 the darkness with Frodo to reveal the wall for Gollum to climb.  At the 
 top, Gollum can push off the rock onto the lower tile floor.  Smash the 
 objects in the area to find a dig spot, where you'll find the rest of the 
 pieces of the floor, then push the rock to the right so you can hop up the 
 next set of stairs.

 At the top, enter the dark cave to the right and smash open the box to find 
 a rock.  Throw it to the left to uncover a hook, then rope the rocks down 
 so you can cross using the rails, then continue up.  At the top, have 
 Gollum climb up and smash the webbings on the wall.  He can then assemble 
 a lever and jump onto it to drop the rock, clearing the way.  Head up the 
 crawlspace with Sam and dig up the plant.  You can now reach the top.

The Tunnel -
 It's just Frodo and Gollum for the moment, and Frodo automatically has his 
 light out.  Have him lead the way into the cave, because there are a bunch 
 of little spiders that only his light can repel.  Continue deep into the 
 cave until you have to smash down some debris.  After that is a LEGO wall, 
 but first have Frodo get close to remove the spiders.  Once Gollum climbs, 
 have him push the box off the edge so Frodo can enter a crawlspace.  Head 
 up it, then continue with Frodo in the lead.

 Cut down any webs in your way and push forward.  Next, you'll need to 
 smash a bunch of bones at the end of the passage so you can assemble rails 
 to climb up.  Smash the rocks and bones in the area.  Assemble a little 
 hanging basket, then throw the small rocks into it.  Once it breaks the 
 web, you're free to continue.

The Chase -
 Run!

"That line was broken!" - The King of the Dead
*grabbing his neck* "It has been remade." - Aragorn

True Adventurer at 90,000

Characters: Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas

---

Walkthrough - 

City of the Dead -
 Aragorn is now armed with Andúril, the Flame of the West, which allows him 
 to slice up Morgul blocks.

 Now, be careful to watch the mist in this area.  In areas where it flows 
 towards a circular center, walking into it will trap you and you'll have to 
 hammer on a button to get out.  Annoying.  Also annoying are spots where 
 the mist rises up, because ghosts will pop out of those and you'll have to 
 rely on Aragorn to beat them.

 So, head straight into the cave, avoiding those traps I warned you about.  
 The first important room you'll reach has Morgul blocks in it.  Hack them 
 all down and assemble a ramp to move on.  Continue until you reach an open 
 cavern.

 This area requires you to knock down the structure in the back.  Head to 
 the left and bust the cracked block, then send Gimli through the crawlspace 
 and have Legolas jump up to join him.  Shoot the hole to make a pole, 
 then flip up and push the box down so Gimli can construct a ladder and 
 climb up.  Make your way to the back by moving along the rail so you avoid 
 the mist, then have Gimli go to the back right and slam on the cracked 
 block to clear the way.

 The next important thing is further down the passage.  Two targets for 
 Legolas to shoot.  This clears the way to the next open cavern.  Go to the 
 left and have Gimli smash the crack, then assemble the rail and have 
 Legolas jump up.  Put an arrow in the hole and flip across to the right, 
 then push the box off the edge.  Drop down and have Aragorn smash the 
 Morgul blocks.  Continue on and have Gimli smash the crack at the end.

 This is the last open cavern.  Go to the right hand side and slash the 
 Morgul block beneath the statue so you can move it.  Send all three 
 characters up the ladder.  Cross the rope with Legolas, then use Aragorn 
 to toss Gimli across to him.  Gimli can now slam the crack up here and 
 assemble the crawlspace so he can head to the left side.  Push the spinner 
 on the other side, then head through the gate.

King of the Dead -
 First, smash all four cracks.  Assemble the bricks and make sure Aragorn 
 is taking out the ghosts.  Hop onto your structure and hit the King as he 
 swoops down.  Once you hit him three times, he'll break your strcuture, so 
 build a new one and hit him three more times.  Lastly, build four different 
 structures and make sure you hop to the right one the King swoops towards 
 to hit him.

Walkthrough - 

Shelob - 
 Yes, for some reason, since you have to have a second player, you have the 
 help of Shagrat the orc in this fight against Shelob.  What you'll need to 
 do is collect the phial and Sting near Frodo.  Hold the phial to chase 
 away Shelob, then take out Sting and press Circle in the glowing circle 
 to attack.  Once you stab the spider, it will climb up on the wall, so 
 throw the phial at it to get it down, otherwise you'll be dealing with 
 little spiders and web shots.  Continue this tactic for three attacks and 
 you'll drive up Shelob.

The Tower -
 Fling Sam's rope above you to drag down the light fixture, then throw the 
 nearby rock at the chain to drop it onto the stuck orc.  Head down 
 yourselves, then head into the darkness to the left with Frodo to find a 
 cog for the gate.  Place it, then head down the stairs.  Clean out all the 
 orcs down here, then head out the gate.

Courtyard - 
 To make it out of here, you'll need to disguise yourselves as orcs in 
 armor.  Let's take all of the pieces in turn:

 Orc Armor #1: Head to the right, pick up a nearby small rock, and throw 
  it at the pipe above.  The orc beneath it will jump into the shower and 
  toss out his armor.

 Orc Helmet #1: Head over to the green banners to the right of the gate.  
  Burn them, then grab the nearby rope to burn the other parts.  Assemble 
  the pieces to make a catapult, then hop in so you launch yourself to 
  the right.  Use your rope to climb up, then head to the right and smash 
  the barrels to hit the orc on the stairs.  Take the helmet.

 Orc Helmet #2: Assemble the pieces near the end of the stairs so Frodo can 
  go up, then at the top, put on your Elven Cloak so you can sneak by the 
  orc so he won't shut the gate on you.  Climb up the nearby ladder, then 
  smash up the barrel and the rocks so you can find two pieces of a hammer.  
  You can use this hammer like Gimli would, so smash the floor so you can 
  take out the orc inside and his helmet.  Turn the crank to open the 
  gate.

 Orc Armor #2: Head further left and burn down the wood.  Head left and push 
  both boxes over the edge, then assemble all the pieces.  Push the platform 
  all the way to the right and smash the boarded up window to find the 
  armor.  Now, all you have to do is have both characters stand in front of 
  each guard and you're done.

Walkthrough - 

The Charge -
 DEEEAAAATTTTHHH!!!

The Flying Beast -
 First, we need to unhorse the Witch-king, as it were.  Stay far away from 
 its attacks and wait until it slams its head into the ground and is 
 stunned.  Slash it three times, then wait for your opportunity again.  
 Keep it up until the beast is down.

The Witch-King -
 Remember when you fought the Troll and you needed to stand on spots so it 
 would get stuck?  Same deal here.  Stand on the marked spot until the 
 Witch-king shrieks, then move and, once its mace is stuck, slash it.  You'll 
 need to make two more spots like that.  Build one to your right, and the 
 third is to the left beneath some scrub.  Once you use all three of those 
 spots, you'll be able to finish him off.

Mumakil -
 And now for the big targets.  There are two types of mumakil to take down.  
 One type is easy.  They have anklets of Morgul blocks, so Aragorn just needs 
 to slash them, then he'll automatically hop up to the top and take out the 
 driver.  For the other kind, Legolas has to shoot arrows into the holes 
 on the side, then flip up to the top using the poles and ropes, then take 
 out the driver.  You have to take out two, then three.

Walkthrough - 

You'll be focusing on Trolls and Nazgûl here.  First, a Troll will attack.  
Have Gimli smash the cracked block, then assemble it into a platform to 
stand on so the Troll hits it.  Next, some catapults will fire.  Smash the 
rocks, assemble them into a platform, then lure the Troll onto it for the 
next hit.  Lastly, three Morgul blocks will be tossed.  Slash them up with 
Andúril, assemble them, and get the last hit on that Troll.

Now a Nazgûl will swoop in.  Keep away from it until it rears up, exposing 
the target on its chest, then have Legolas fire at it.

Now the battle will take you to the side of the gate.  A second Troll has 
shown up to tango.  Head towards it and shoot the armor on each of its 
shoulders with arrows.  It will smash the rocks to the left.  Assemble the 
pieces and head through the crawlspace.  Press Circle in the glowing circle 
to knock the Troll around.  Once it's stunned, have Legolas shoot it.

You'll now head back to the center.  Another Nazgûl will show up.  Deal with 
it the same way as before.  A third Troll will attack.  All you can do 
with this Troll is wait until it tires itself, then have Aragorn attack it 
to remove its armor.  Once both pieces are gone, it will run off to the 
side.

In this area, assemble the pieces and fire arrows into the holes so Legolas 
can flip up to the ledge, then uncover the platform, bait the Troll into 
hitting it, then jump out and shoot him.

Walkthrough - 

The Slope -
 So, we've got problems.  For one, Frodo is so weary he can't jump.  For 
 another, we're on an active volcano.  So, head to the right and smash the 
 boxes to find pieces for a ramp.  Head right, hop onto the island in the 
 middle of the lava, and rope the rocks down so Frodo can cross.  Next, 
 position Frodo on the little rock near the rails, then hop up as Sam and 
 rope to the upper ledge.  Stand on the rock near the lava jet to make it 
 go down and Frodo's go up.  Remember this, as you'll be doing it a few 
 times as you go through.

 Head into the darkness with Frodo and push the rock into the lava.  Dig 
 up the spot with Sam to find a rock, then throw it at the rock to the 
 right to fully block the flow.  Continue to the right, past the jets in 
 the walls, then leap onto the rails to pull off some rocks.  Time your 
 movements so Frodo can get across, then proceed further right.

 Head into the darkness beneath the colored blocks.  Make sure Sam stays 
 with you as you go through.  On the other side, fling Sam's rope at the 
 hook to pull the rocks down to cross.  Now you have the two lava holes 
 balance thing again.  Have Sam jump on the left one so Frodo can go up on 
 the right.  Unfortunately, Frodo can't go forward anymore, and Sam can't 
 go with him, so head back to the left and smash the rocks to uncover a 
 plank.  Drop Frodo from the plank onto the left-hand rock to raise Sam up.  
 Sam can cross the gap to the right, dig up the pieces, and assemble them 
 into a bridge for Frodo.

 Use the rope again to pull down the rocks.  You'll find another lava 
 balance.  Put Frodo on the right and have Sam rope up to the left.  Once 
 Frodo gets off on solid ground, smash up the rocks to put together a pillar 
 on the tiles.  Push Frodo to the right, then have him go through the dark 
 cave on the back wall and smash the rocks to block the lava.  Both of you 
 can now go through the crawlspace to the top.

 Gollum wants a piece of you, now.  Alternate between Frodo and Sam 
 throwing rocks at him.  Knock him in the head five times to move on.

The Cracks of Doom -
 First, Frodo needs to shake off Gollum.  Have Sam smack Gollum to knock a 
 heart off.  Gollum will knock you down to a lower level.  Assemble the 
 pieces, then climb back up using the rails.

 After the next hit, Gollum will knock you down to a different area.  
 Assemble the pieces and use the rope to go to the right, then assemble 
 again and climb out.  Hit Gollum one more time, then have Frodo assemble 
 the blocks to let Sam climb back out, and hit Gollum one last time.

The End of All Things -
 Run.

Congratulations!  You've destroyed the One Ring and saved Middle-earth!  
Now, you can follow the stud trail to the Bonus Level.  You're also free 
to go on a collecting spree, as well as use any character you've unlocked 
in Middle-earth at any time, so enjoy!

Once you finish with everything, go back to Bag End, and press Circle on 
the ring marker in front of it to see the final cutscene.

******************************************************************************
5. FREE PLAY RUNTHROUGHS
******************************************************************************

Okay, in this section we go mission by mission and list all fourteen 
objects you can pick up during the Free Play run.  Like in so many past 
LEGO games, how Free Play works is that you select your characters, and 
then you're given several more so you can access all the secrets.

Also, if you don't get the character you need in the selection that is 
picked for you, you can always hold down Triangle and access the full 
menu whenever you want.  Well, ALMOST whenever you want.  There are certain 
times in certain missions where you're locked in to a certain character and 
can't switch, such as when Frodo has the Ring on, for example.

Anyway, you can select Free Play of any completed mission from anywhere on 
the map.  You don't have to walk up to the mission's banner in the world.  
Just bring up the map, find the banner on it, then select it.

So, with each item, I may note that you need something in particular.  
Here's a list of what they mean, when they're not specific characters:

Free Play - You'll need to do it on Free Play, most likely because you'll 
 have the characters already in your stable, just not access to them yet, 
 or you'll need to be able to hot switch on the fly.

Spade - You need either Sam, or the Mithril Trowel forged.

Arrows - You'll need Legolas or another archer character.  Most likely 
 Legolas will be the best bet, as some acrobatics might be required as well.

Rope - You'll need either Sam's rope or a rope item, like the Mithril Rope.

Phial - You'll need Frodo's phial he got from Galadriel.

Strength - You'll need an orc character (such as Shagrat, whom you get for 
 free), or the Mithril Boxing Gloves.

Explosives - You'll need either Mithril Fireworks or the Berserker character.

==============
5A. Prologue =
==============

Minikit #1 - (Spade) During the battle, go to the back left corner of 
 the field and dig up this minikit.

Minikit #2 - (Arrows) During the battle, in the far distance are three 
 siege towers.  Shoot the targets on them.

Treasure #1 *Elven Sword* - (Explosives) While fighting Sauron, go to the 
 back left and blast open the mithril rocks to find this.

Treasure #2 *Magma Armor* - (Spade) At the beginning of the climb up the 
 slopes, smash the nearby lava flow rock and find a dig pile under it.  Dig 
 it up with Sam.

Minikit #3 - (Gimli, Gollum) In the very beginning of the climb up the 
 slopes, throw Gimli at the cracked block on the wall to enter a new area.  
 In this sauna, you'll need to climb up to the top.  Use a rope in the 
 back to reach the second ledge, then throw Gimli across to the right.  Have 
 Gollum cross and climb up, then switch to a Narsil wielder (like Elendil) 
 and smack the Morgul block.  Now, drop down to the water and pick up the 
 minikit.

Treasure #3 *Shimmering Armor* - (Strength) In the same area as Minikit #3, 
 head to the far right and pull open the orange handle.

Blacksmith Design *Mithril Shockwave Axe* - (Gimli) In the same area as 
 Minikit #3, go behind the cabinet that held the treasure and smash open the 
 wall to find the design.

Minikit #4 - (Gimli) Destroy five statues of Sauron.  They are in the 
 following places:
 1. In the same area as Minikit #3, at the back of the pool
 2. In the main path, before the river of fire that you shimmy across.
 3. Before the first marked "elf jump" point.
 4 and 5. Flanking the gate to the Cracks of Doom at the end.

Minikit #5 - (Gimli, Legolas) After crossing the second river of fire, 
 you'll note some flame jets blasting out of the wall.  Throw Gimli at the 
 cracked block on the left and assemble the pieces to block one, then have 
 Legolas shoot the target above the righthand one.  This will give you pieces 
 for the minikit.

Minikit #6 - (Rope) At the third river of fire (which you have shimmy 
 across) stand on the left-hand bank and toss the rope at the little 
 raft.

Minikit #7 - (Phial) After the third river of fire, some orcs will jump out 
 of a dark passage.  Go in with a phial to find this one.

Minikit #8 - After pushing the rock off into the fourth river of fire, 
 climb up with Isildur and smack the Morgul rocks blocking the back passage 
 to this minikit.

Minikit #9 - (Explosives) Just before the gate to the Cracks of Doom, blast 
 the mithril cage to the left, then crawl through the crawlspace.

Minikit #10 - (Arrows) At the Cracks of Doom, there's a target just above 
 the gate that closed.  Shoot it to drop the minikit.

=====================
5B. The Black Rider =
=====================

Minikit #1 - (Strength) At the very beginning, pull open the orange handle 
 on the rock and drop down to a new cave.  There's a mole down here that 
 you'll have to corral into a certain spot.  First, light the fire to the 
 left to drop a tree on one hole, then shoot an arrow at the hanging rocks 
 over the second hole.  Next, go to the back and hang on the rope to lower 
 a rock so you can jump up to the right with Legolas, head left, then 
 switch to Gimli and smash the cracked block over the third hole.  For the 
 fourth hole, head to the right with Frodo and enter the dark cave.  This 
 will scare the mole to the center hole and knock out the minikit.

Minikit #2 - (Strength) This is also down in the cave behind the orange 
 handle, only it's quite visible in the upper left, and you'll likely trip 
 over it in the process.

Minikit #3 - This one is easily spotted behind a tree in the first area.

Treasure #1 *Ferryman's Hat* - (Free Play) Just before crossing the first 
 patch of water, head to the foreground to find a path that curves down in 
 front.  At the end, smash the Morgul blocks and assemble a Ringwraith 
 scarecrow.

Minikit #4 - (Explosives) At the first water crossing is a mithril rock.  
 Blast it.

Treasure #2 *Soup Pot* - (Phial) Just after the first water crossing is a 
 small dark cave.  The pot's inside, and you'll need Frodo's phial to get 
 in.

Minikit #5 - This one can be a pain in the butt.  It's during the fight 
 with Saruman.  What you need to do is throw him into the window with the 
 lock on it.  Unfortunately, that window can be tough to target, and it may 
 take more than one shot to clear away the other objects in the area.

Minikit #6 - (Arrows) There are five nests in the trees to fire at in the 
 second part of the forest.  They start at the very beginning of the second 
 area, just past the rolling rock, and are spaced rather evenly towards 
 the end.

Minikit #7 - (Gimli) Just before the second water crossing, you'll find a
 cracked block on a fallen tree.  Smash it down.

Blacksmith Design *Mithril Music Horn* - (Rope) At the second water 
 crossing, smash down the bridge parts and head to the back.  Use the rope on 
 the rock to the left.

Treasure #3 *Mushroom Crown* - (Rope, Aragorn) At the second water crossing, 
 smash down the bridge parts and head to the back.  Use the rope at the back 
 water wall to pull down an item that Aragorn can use to track.  Follow it 
 out of the water to the left, then you'll dig up a second item.  Follow 
 it to the right to the crown itself.  You'll have to move the Nazgûl away 
 from the hollowed log to get to it.

Minikit #8 - (Gollum) In the hollowed log is a LEGO wall.  Climb up it with 
 Gollum.

Minikit #9 - After you go through the hollow log, walk in front of it, 
 smash the bush, and dig up the minikit.

Minikit #10 - There is a minikit on the right side of the road during the 
 chase.  Just hug the right side and you should grab it.

================
5C. Weathertop =
================

Minikit #1 - (Phial) In the first area, walk into the dark passage near 
 where Frodo's sleeping.

Minikit #2 - (Rope) In the first area, flip a rope up to gold hook on the 
 rock high above.

Treasure #1 *Rubber Duck* - (Arrows) In the first area, shoot the target 
 near the water to scare this up.

Minikit #3 - (Arrows) In the first area, shoot an arrow into the hole in 
 the back, then flip up to the minikit.

Blacksmith Design *Mithril Music Boots* - (Phial) As soon as you enter the 
 second area, go back into the dark tunnel to find this.

Minikit #4 - There are three purple plants along the trip up to Amon Sul.  
 1. Just past the rocks you knock down with other rocks.
 2. After bouncing over the purple flower suspended over the briar patch.
 3. Just before the stairs to the top.

Minikit #5 - (High Jump) In the second area, after Sam builds a bouncy 
 plant, hop off it onto the rails to the right, and keep moving right to 
 find this one.

Minikit #6 - (Strength) Just before jumping over the briar patch in the 
 second area is an orange handle on the rock wall.  Pull it open.

Minikit #7 - (Gimli) Before going up the stairs to the third area, use 
 Gimli to knock down a cracked block to the right.

Treasure #2 *Quill* - (Gimli, Narsil, Aragorn) Before going up the stairs 
 to the third area, use Gimli to knock down a cracked block to the right, 
 then smash down the Morgul blocks to find a tracking item.  Use Aragorn 
 to track it to the left to find another item, then track back to the 
 right to find the quill.

Treasure #3 *Sun Hat* - (Gimli) At Amon Sul, go to the right, switch to 
 Gimli, and knock down the cracked block, and the next one behind it.  Take 
 the hat.

Minikit #8 - (Arrows) At Amon Sul, find three tiny targets in the area 
 for Legolas to shoot down.

Minikit #9 - (Strength) At Amon Sul, wrench open the orange handle chest 
 in the back left. 

Minikit #10 - (Explosives) At Amon Sul, blast the silver pillar on the left, 
 then assemble the pump with Frodo.  Switch back and turn the crank to get 
 the minikit.

===========================
5D. The Pass of Caradhras =
===========================

Minikit #1 - There are five skeletons on the cliffside wearing bronze 
 helmets.  Smash each of them:
 1. Just left of the starting point.
 2. Small cave just past the first snow drift where you push a rock.
 3. In the back of the first campsite.
 4. To the right of same campsite, up the slanted rope, at the end of the 
  ledge.
 5. Through the first crawlspace after the rockfall.

Minikit #2 - There are four pennants with flags on the mountainside.  Smash 
 each of them:
 1. After the second snow drift.
 2. After the first campsite, go left past the cracked block on the wall.
 3. Halfway through the rockfall
 4. After the rockfall, go through the first crawlspace and smash the 
  cracked block, then have Sam dig up the planks and head to the right.

Minikit #3 - (Free Play) To the right of the first campsite, after Legolas 
 goes up the rope to the right, switch to Gimli and slam the cracked block.  
 Next, assemble the snowman and have Legolas shoot it.

Minikit #4 - (Explosives) Just at the end of the rockfall are several mithril 
 boulders stacked against the wall.  Knock enough down to get into the little 
 cave.

Minikit #5 - (Strength) Past the rockfall, you should see a rope trail 
 hanging down.  Rope up to it, then pull apart the orange handled chest at 
 the top.

Minikit #6 - (Explosives) Once you go through the first crawlspace after the 
 rockfall, you should see some mithril boards on a cave entrance.  Blast them 
 away, then walk into the cave with a Phial.

Blacksmith Design *Mithril Cluster Bow* - After the rockfall, there's a point 
 where you assemble some planks.  After you go right across the gap, instead 
 of going up, go towards the screen to find the design on a ledge.

Treasure #1 *Bill's Riding Crop* - (Free Play) At the Moria gate, smash the 
 Morgul blocks with Narsil to find both Bill and his riding crop behind it.

Minikit #7 - (Free Play) Once you free Bill (see above), slowly walk him to 
 the right along the stud trail to find the minikit.

Treasure #2 *Luminous Stone* - (Explosives) At the Moria gate, blast the 
 mithril rock on the left side and take the tracking item beneath it.  Follow 
 the trail through three tracking items to the right to find this.

Minikit #8 - Time to disturb the water.  Under three large rocks are smaller 
 throwable rocks.  Throw each of these at the three green bottles floating 
 in the water.

Minikit #9 - (Gollum) Climb up the left side with Legolas.  Halfway up, 
 switch to Frodo and go inside the cave with his Phial.  In the cave, use 
 Gollum to climb up the wall, then switch to Sam and light the fire, freeing 
 the troll.  It wants a fish, so hop down and smash the ice with Gimli to 
 free up an area, then fish it up and bring it to the troll.

Treasure #3 *Ice Lolly* - (Free Play) Go to the same cave as Minikit #9.  
 From the troll, go towards the screen and destroy several rocks to find a 
 dig spot.  Dig up the lolly.

Minikit #10 - (Rope) While fighting the Watcher, use a Rope on the obvious 
 sparkling line at the right edge, climb up, and smash the plant to find 
 this one.

========================
5E. The Mines of Moria =
========================

Minikit #1 - (Strength) In the first part, pull on the orange handled chest 
 on the right side.

Minikit #2 - (Strength) You need to find three Dwarven statues in Balin's 
 Tomb.  They are behind orange handles that need to be pulled.  The first 
 is in the first area on the left side.  The latter two are when you're 
 defending the door, on the upper ledges on either side.

Blacksmith Design *Mithril Headdress* - While the orcs are pounding on the 
 door, head to the right and into a small alcove to find this.

Minikit #3 - (Explosives) You must destroy three sets of Morgul bricks.  
 They're all in the Halls of Durin after the Balrog first roars.  The first 
 is on the right.  The second is past the mithril pillar that you need to 
 blast down.  The third is off to the left.

Minikit #4 - (Explosives) In the Halls of Durin, blast down the mithril 
 pillar, then behind it, use a rope on a golden hook on the ground.

Treasure #1 *House Key* - (Strength, Explosives) In the Halls of Durin, blast 
 down the mithril pillar, then behind it, pull over the cart to knock this 
 out of it.

Minikit #5 - (Explosives) In the same area as Minikit #4, bust up the mine 
 carts and assemble the pieces to the wall.  Now, the top of the wall is 
 still kinda broken, so you need to aim Gollum juuust right up the middle 
 to get to the minikit.  Keep trying, it can be done.

Treasure #2 *Moria Orc's Helmet* - (Free Play) At the first part of the 
 bridge (the stairs), shoot a target near the entrance to drop this.

Minikit #6 - (Explosives) As you go down the stairs to the bridge, you'll 
 see a wall of mithril rocks.  Blast them away and enter a new room.  Shoot 
 the targets on the back wall twice each to drop this minikit.

Minikit #7 - (Explosives) In the same area as Minikit #6, go up to the organ 
 and stand in front of it to get the wheels moving.  As the lit up set of 
 lights reaches the bottom step on the switch.  Do this for all three colors, 
 and then three sets of the three.  Although I've never seen it, this is 
 apparently a reference to "The Goonies".

Minikit #8 - At the broken pillar area, after you fling Gimli to the left, 
 go down the crawlspace, and then walk around behind the pillar.

Treasure #3 *Artist's Hat* - At the far end of the bridge, there's a crane.  
 Have Legolas grab the crane to pull up a box with this inside it.  If 
 you're on Free Play, you'll have to wait until Gandalf is finished so you 
 have a second character to grab the item.

Minikit #9 - (Free Play) Once you start the last area, have Frodo use his 
 phial inside a small dark cave before you go up the stairs.

Minikit #10 - At the exit gate, look up and have Legolas shoot at two targets 
 to drop the pieces of the minikit.

==============
5F. Amon Hen =
==============

Minikit #1 - (Mithril Bow) There are six statues that need to be hit, and 
 since you can't switch Frodo, you'll need to forge a bow of some kind in 
 order to get them all.
 1. Frodo - First set of stairs, an obvious target.
 2. Frodo - Near the catapult, shoot the target
 3. Frodo - While on the ledge to the right of the overhanging gate that 
  knocks away Boromir.
 4. Aragorn - At the water landing on the far left.
 5. Aragorn - Partway up the path, just past the fallen tree.
 6. Aragorn - At the end of the path, amongs the ruins.

Minikit #2 - In Frodo's path, there's a spot where you throw a rock at a 
 stone hand, then create stairs from its fingers.  Once that's done, smash 
 the remaining hand to find a minikit behind it.

Minikit #3 - (Mithril Bow) Again, you'll need to forge a bow for Frodo to 
 use.  After the catapult, further up the path is a target.  Shoot it to 
 roll the boulder back down to the catapult.  Fire it again to release this 
 minikit.

Treasure #1 *Stop Wand* - (Rope, Axe) You need both some kind of rope and an 
 axe.  For example, forge a Mithril Rope and a Mithril Shockwave Axe.  
 Anyway, after you chase off Boromir for the last time in Frodo's path, drop 
 down to where he stood and use the rope above you.  You'll climb up to the 
 ledge above.  Smash that with the axe to drop the wand.

Minikit #4 - (Strength) Smash four Morgul rocks in Aragorn's path.
 1. Near the water landing.
 2. Through the orange handle at the far left of the water landing.
 3. On the upper platform where you push a pillar off the edge.
 4. At the end of Aragorn's path, amongst the ruins.

Minikit #5 - (Free Play) At the water landing, first use a rope to pull down 
 the statue on the left, then switch to a wizard and magic the pieces 
 together in the correct order to match the right-hand statue.

Treasure #2 *Arrow Helmet* - (Strength) You need to complete another cooking 
 puzzle like you did back at Weathertop.  First, head to the left, pull down 
 the orange handle, and you'll find a ghost sitting on a chest.  He's who 
 you need to make the meal for.  Dig near the ghost to find a fish, then 
 dig up in the upper right corner to find an egg, and last, use your rope 
 on the gold hook near the path up the hill to find the tomato.  Mix them 
 together, then put them on the spot next to the fire.  The ghost will leave 
 and you can get the helmet.

Minikit #6 - While pushing the pillars around on the block pushing area, 
 push them to the back right corner and hop Legolas up to the hole in the 
 rock to find this one.

Minikit #7 - (Free Play) When you reach the top of the hillside with 
 Aragorn, you'll see a structure with a dark cave beneath it.  Walk in with 
 Frodo and smash the rock inside.

Treasure #3 *Uruk Sword* - (Explosives) Once the uruk-hai attack, go through 
 the fallen tree, then look left and blow up the mithril pillars to knock 
 them down.  The item is behind it.

Minikit #8 - (Free Play) In the third area of the uruk-hai attack, dig 
 near the back left corner to grow a plant that will reach to the minikit.

Minikit #9 - (Explosives) In the third area of the uruk-hai attack, go down 
 and to the right to find a path leading to the mithril gate.  Blast it down 
 and head inside.  Once inside, rope up to the next area, then shoot the 
 target.  Continue up the tower.  Jump up to the top as Legolas and use Sam 
 to burn the brush blocking the crawlspace.  Enter and hop up on the 
 mushroom to the minikit.

Minikit #10 - (Free Play) In the final area with Lurtz, use a rope to pull 
 down a gold hook to find a target.  This is one of six targets in the 
 immediate area that need to be shot.

 You can get there easily with a hobbit.

===================
5G. Taming Gollum =
===================

 wall.

 rocks on your right to uncover a crawlspace.  Go through.

 off and to the left to drop onto a ledge with an orange handle.  Pull it 
 to open the door.  Smack the snowman to get his head.

 block out to the left, then plant in the dirt pile to bounce up to the 
 minikit.

Minikit #5 - To the right of where Frodo and Sam start, there's a spot 
 where Sam can attach his rope to a rock.

Minikit #6 - (Free Play) Each of the purple plants you create has a target

 block.

Minikit #8 - (Free Play) In the back area of the circular path is a cracked

Minikit #9 - Near the Save Statue during the Gollum fight are three clumps 
 of rocks.  Smash all of them and put the pieces together.

Minikit #10 - (Explosives) During the Gollum fight, enter the back cave with 
 Frodo to find some mithril rocks.  Blow them up with explosives and head 
 into a new cave.  This cave requires Gollum to climb on the walls and reach 
 the crank on the left and put it on the mechanism on the right.  It requires 
 the other character to move some panels to rotate the walls so Gollum can 
 reach them.  It's a bit maddening, and takes some practice.

Treasure #3 *Fishing Rod* - You get this item as a matter of going through 
 the story.

======================
5H. The Dead Marshes =
======================

Minikit #1 - (Free Play) Near the starting point, smash the cracked block

 it to get the minikit.

Minikit #2 - (Free Play) There are five cracked blocks that, when struck, 
 cough up skeletons from the bog.

  point. 
 2. The second island (the first fire) in the upper-left corner.
 3. The bottom right area, where you fill up for the third fire.
 4. After the second fire, Gollum will double back through the path, which 
  passes close to this one.
 5. This one is close to the large ribcage you walk through.

Treasure #1 *Wooden Bucket* - You find this one going through the area 
 normally.

Minikit #3 - Once you're at the third fire, look down south to see a little 
 patch of LEGO weeds floating in the water.  Jump on it and more will appear 
 out of the water.  Follow the path and pull the rope hook at the end to 
 get this minikit.

Minikit #4 - (Strength) In the western area with the large ribcage is a 
 rock with an orange handle.  Open it and a path to a minikit will be made.

Minikit #5 - (Free Play) You should see the set of Morgul blocks when you 
 go to get some more water, so smash them down.  This will cause a boat to 
 appear, and you'll need to find two bones and combine them to make a 
 steering wheel.  Once you do that, take it back to the ghost to get the 
 minikit.

Minikit #6 - (Free Play) Once you begin the sneaking section, shoot at the 
 target on a LEGO tree in the background.

 left of the area and find a dig spot.

Minikit #10 - In the fight with the Haradrim, there are five targets spread 
 throughout the area, but they're all on the sides, and they all pop up and 
 down really fast, so be careful and make Faramir's shots count.

 a minikit.

 and find a dirt pile to dig up a pick-a-nick basket, which produces a bear,

 throw another boulder.  It will move to the minikit, so throw one last 
 boulder.

Minikit #10 - To the right of the tree that the orcs set on fire, walk over the

 four colored blocks, then use Gandalf to assemble them into stairs.  Hop up 
 them to the minikit.

 a flag.  The pole is found first, and rather early.  There are two targets 
 where Faramir shoots arrows to let Frodo and Sam through gates.  The spot 
 you need to find is to the left of those targets.  There's a rail on the 
 tower.  Leap up to it with an elf and grab the pole.  The rest happens

 up on the left.  It's tough to reach, even with an elf character.  What 
 you need to do is go up a little path to its left so you have a higher 
 vantage point, then leap out to the right.  It's NOT easy, but keep trying 
 as it can be done.

Minikit #10 - During the fight with the King, shoot arrows at three targets 
 high on the walls.  There are two on the left and one on the right.

==================
5O. Cirith Ungol =

 the mithril blocks under the tables to get the food items.  Put them all 
 together and a couple of orcs will show up, one with the hat.

 2. To the right of the Save Statue.
 3. Behind the bulkhead with the mithril lock.

 to the vine to load and fire a blue barrel cannon.  Get out to the courtyard 
 and smash twenty barrels in the time limit.

Minikit #10 - (Free Play) Above the orc who shuts the gate on you, you'll find 
 some Morgul blocks.  Smash them and assemble a ballista.  Fire it, then

 handle.  Assemble them, then pull the handle.  You'll find a guy who wants 
 the first-aid kit that you make from the herbs, so give it to him.

Minikit #7 - (Free Play) While fighting the Mumakil, note two things with 
 a purple aura.  Pick up the broken spear, and then the wrappings to make 
 a crutch, then set fire to the nearby spot to free the soldier.  Give him

******************************************************************************
6. MIDDLE-EARTH EXPLORATION
******************************************************************************

So, Middle-earth is a nice huge place to explore, full of all sorts of little 
puzzles and challenges.

First, a note about the map.  The map is your friend.  It even helps you 
find things.  Make sure you seek out Map Stones in every area.  There's one 
for every area I have marked here, and every time you visit a Map Stone, all 
of the stuff you can find in that area appears on your map.  If you want to 
find that specific item, simply select it on the map and "Set Destination" 
and the game will give you the best path to it, even if it seems to be buried 
in the mountains.

Under each Map Stone, you can find how many of five possible things are in 
the area:

Side Quests: Represented as green question marks initially.  These are little 
 fetch quests that require you to find or forge an item.  Simply walk up to 
 the person and they'll tell you what they want, and even give a hint if 
 it's a Treasure to be found in Free Play.  Sometimes the person is "hidden" 
 behind a small challenge of its own, and you'll find that info on how to 
 get to them in each entry.  Give them the item they ask for and you'll get 
 either a Mithril Brick or a Red Brick will appear for purchase.

Red Bricks: These are, of course, Extras which go in your Extras Menu once 
 purchased.  I have a list of them way down in Section 8C that describes the 
 function of each one.  You can ONLY get Red Bricks from completing Side 
 Quests, so I haven't listed how to get them here, as it'd be seriously 
 redundant.

Characters: Looking like a golden statue, these are extra characters wandering 
 Middle-earth looking to be purchased.  They will appear in their respective 
 areas after completing Story Missions, although you may not be able to get 
 to them right away, let alone afford them.  Section 7 is my list of 
 characters, including their prices, so I don't bother to list them here.  
 They're pretty obvious anyway.

 NOTE: For some weird reason, once you purchase Characters, they disappear 
 from the Map Stone list, whereas nothing else does.  I have no idea why.  I'm 
 honestly probably the only one who cares since I was trying to add everyone 
 up, but there you go.

Mithril Bricks: Silver colored bricks are the main form of currency in this 
 game.  You turn them in to the Blacksmith to forge cool stuff.  There are 
 a total of 250 in the game, so get collecting!

Blacksmith Design: These are brought to the Blacksmith so he can make all 
 your cool stuff.  There are a bunch found in Middle-earth as well as one in 
 each Story Mission.

---

So, a couple of notes before we begin.  Note that in some cases, time is 
important for items.  Hover over certain items to see whether they have a 
sun or moon behind them.  That means they're specific to day or night, 
respectively.  While you're within the story, you can't change the time.  
Once you complete it, you can change the time whenever you fast-travel using 
Map Stones.

Also, the directions I give you for the location are pretty simple and 
vague.  This is because the map will exactly mark where you need to go and 
guide you there if you need it, so use it.  Makes things a lot easier than 
me trying to point you there, so use my locations as a reference along with 
your map to find stuff.

6C. Weathertop =
================

*Entering the Barrow Downs*

Well, I assume they're the Barrow Downs because they're inhabited by 
ghosties.  This is a special cut off area to the north that's somewhat 
tough to get to, and I'd rather not describe it for each entry.

 phial to see inside the little cave.

Location: North of the river north of Weathertop.
Needs: Arrows and Gimil

====================================
6Q. BONUS LEVEL: LEGO Middle-earth =
====================================

There honestly isn't much to say about this one.  After you complete the 
story, the stud trail in Middle-earth to Rivendell, and then behind a 
waterfall where you'll find the access to this bonus level.

In the bonus level, you are SAURON and the MOUTH OF SAURON, and your 
objective is to WRECK EVERYTHING.  As you stroll around this small 
representation of Middle-earth, you need to earn a million studs by 
smashing it all.

There are a couple of notes.  For one, you can switch to other characters 
while here.  Unfortunately, for some reason, switching away from Sauron 
and the Mouth means you can't switch back.  Don't worry, you'll get both 
of them for reals after you complete this.

As for other stuff in the mission itself, make sure you use bombs to clear 
out the high parts of areas.  Also, there's a crank at the Argonath which 
is in Moria, which you can totally go inside.  Lastly, smash Mount Doom 
repeatedly to get pieces to rebuild Barad-dúr into the most awesome place.

Once you get the million (and trust me, it isn't hard), the level ends, 
you get to keep all the studs, and you get the two bad bros for keeps.

******************************************************************************
8. SECRETS/UNLOCKABLES
******************************************************************************
=====================
8A. How To Get 100% =
=====================

In the beginning, I'd suggest simply going through the story, as your running 
about in Middle-earth is rather restricted otherwise.  Once the story is 
complete, it's time to get ready for collecting.

First, you'll need everything necessary to get all the items in the 
missions.  For that, you'll definitely need Explosives, so go to Barad-dúr 
and get the design for Mithril Fireworks, and you might as well purchased 
the Berserker for good measure.

You'll also need the following items in your Treasure Trove:
- Mithril Bow of some sort
- Axe of some sort (either Golden Axe or Mithril Shockwave Axe)
- A Rope of some sort (either the Mithril Rope or the Toy Snake)
- Mithril Boxing Gloves
- Mithril Bottomless Bucket

This is because certain times in the missions there won't be a chance to 
switch characters, so you have to rely on items.

Your next priority is stud multipliers.  Spend studs on NOTHING before you 
buy these.  The first should be x2, naturally, but you'll need Explosives 
for it.  x8 and x10 you can get the designs for the first time through their 
levels, but they're prohibitively expensive, so you likely won't be able to 
get them right away.

Once you get those, you're free to go through all the missions and clean up 
Middle-earth.  You should have more than enough studs by then to get 
everything else.

===================
8B. Treasure List =
===================

Here's a quick list of all the treasures in the game!  I also include which 
mission you can find it in and what it does, if anything.  Note that some of

8D. Trophies/Achievements =
===========================

One Ring to build them all. (Platnium)
- Collect every trophy

The next eighteen are all for the Story Missions in order, and then...

My Precious...
- Collect all the Mithril Bricks

There's some good in this world.
- Complete all the Fetch Quests in Middle-earth

There and Back Again.
- Get 100%

I told you he was tricksy.
- Collect all the Red Bricks

Of all the inquisitive Hobbits.
- Unlock all the Map Stones on Middle-earth
NOTE: Specifically, you have to press Circle in front of each one.

Here's a pretty thing!
- Craft every mithril item

Not with 10,000 men...
- Unlock all characters
NOTE: For some weird reason, Lurtz (Newborn) doesn't count for this.

Ready for another adventure.
- Achieve True Adventurer in every level.

The Lord of the Ring.
- Complete the Bonus Level.

Delved too greedily...
- Collect more than 10,000,000,000 studs.

I'm glad to be with you.
- Complete a level in co-op.

Don't tell the Elf...
- Throw Gimli 30 times.

Our only wish to catch a fish!
- Fish perfectly 20 times by pressing the icon as it flashes.
NOTE: This doesn't mean fishing off twenty piers, but hitting the icon 
 perfectly twenty times as the circle rope touches the button.

That is a rare gift.
- Reach the top of Amon Hen without being caught once by Boromir.
NOTE: If he grabs you, then you blew this one.  Try again.

... And away he goes, Precious!
- Defeat Gollum as Gollum
NOTE: Simply switch to Gollum for both characters in Free Play and have one 
 slap up the other.  Easy.

What about second breakfast?
- Complete 2 cooking puzzles
NOTE: Like the one you did on Weathertop.  Heck, you can do it twice if 
 you want.

That one counts as mine!
- Finish one of Gimli's opponents as Legolas in Helm's Deep
NOTE: Not entirely sure on this one.  Just keep killing stuff with Legolas 
 and you'll likely get it.

I've always been taller!
- Use the Ent Draught on Pippin.
NOTE: Specifically, equip a character with the Ent Draught treasure, then 
 hit Pippin with it to make his head grow.

We cannot linger.
- Complete "The Mines of Moria" in under 15 minutes.

Dance of the dead.
- Turn an enemy into a skeleton and make them dance.
NOTE: To do this, first hit them with either the Mithril Skeleton Sword or 
 the Mithril Skeleton Bow, then pull out the Mithril Music Horn or the 
 Mithril Disco Phial.  You can also do this on other hero characters.

Pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
- Defeat 42 Uruk-hai as Legolas.

One does not simply...
- Walk into Mordor.
NOTE: I only received this one after puttering around Mordor for some time, 
 so I'm not entirely sure how to get this.  Just go for all the items in 
 there and try not to worry too much about it.

Great! ...Where are we going?
- Form the Fellowship of the Ring

Taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
- Travel to Isengard as every playable Hobbit.
NOTE: This includes Rosie and Bilbo.  What I suggest is just fast travel 
 as every Hobbit over and over again until you get it.

That still only counts as one!
- Defeat an oliphaunt as Legolas

An expected journey.
- Travel to Trollshaws as Bilbo

Return of the Mushroom King.
- Equip Aragorn with the Mushroom Crown

Worth greater than the Shire.
- Dress a character completely in treasure items.
NOTE: This will mean a hat, armor, footwear, and something in both hands.

It won't be that easy!
- During "Prologue", jump into the fires of Mount Doom as Isildur.
NOTE: Walk to the end of the Cracks of Doom, but don't get too close to 
 the edge.  Jump instead off the side.

A link to the elements.
- Craft the Fire and Ice Bows.

own.  You may not alter it in any way, even if you ask me first, and that 
includes putting it in HTML format.  Please dont post this on your site 
unless you have express consent by me.  Ive put a lot of time into this.  
Give me some credit.

I'm not going to allow people with small personal sites to post this FAQ.  
They may post the link on GameFAQs with all the LEGO LOTR guides, but, 
trying to keep updates, well, updated, I'll only allow large committed sites

9B. E-mail Guidelines =
=======================

If you wish to e-mail me, be sure to follow these guidelines...

- Make ABSOLUTELY sure I haven't already answered your question in the guide.
- Make sure it has something to do with LEGO LOTR.  I don't want spam, 
chain letters, offers for friendship.  Compliment me on the FAQ all you want, 
though.
- Make sure you say LEGO LOTR at one point in your e-mail.  I have more than 
one LEGO FAQ, and asking a generic question such as "How do I beat the last 
level?" doesn't tell me much.
- Spell correctly and use proper grammar, please.  If I can't understand 
your e-mail, it'll go to the junk pile.

9E. The Final Word =
====================

Another awesome entry from Telltale Games, allowing us to enjoy the movies 
in LEGO form, giving us their excellent brand of humor, and throwing in a 
lot of fun to boot.

Also, for those of you keeping score, I do enjoy putting quotes before the 
missions, but with the game being fully voiced, it seemed a little 
redundant, so I challenged myself to use quotes that didn't appear in the 
game.  How did I do?

Next year.  For the Wii U.  LEGO CITY UNDERCOVER.  Can you handle it?  CAN 
YOU HANDLE IT??
