Do not add your own translations to this directory. They will be lost during
theme updates. The only .mo files that should be loaded from here are pre-made
translations that come with the theme.

Store your own translations at wp-content/languages/themes/{theme}-{locale}.mo
(e.g. exodus-en_US.mo) to keep them safe from loss during theme updates.
